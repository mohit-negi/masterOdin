## Plan

> if program has a user Interface --> sketch or write down what you have in mind

> What type of inputs 
> Whats the desired output
# > The steps requred to get the required output

### Pseudocode

Write the algorithm in a simple language laying down simple steps 

## Divide and conquer

Divide bigger problems into subproblems so as to reduce complexity


# Example for the problem solving process

# problem : Fizz Buzz

step 1: Does the required program have a user Interface ? No
step 2: What type of input is expected ? A series of number typed by the user
step 3: What is the expected output ? 
    If the input is divisible by 3 repace it with string fizz
    ,if it is divisible by 5 replace it with string buzz
    and if it is divisible by both replace it with string fizzbuzz
    so the expected output will be in a series of number accompanied by strings
